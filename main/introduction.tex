\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}

\subsubsection{Aim}

The aim of this project is to create a mobile app that allows individuals and corporations track and manage online data associated with them. Moreover, the app should be able to bring added value to the data. Consequently, the app will allow individuals and corporations control the purposes for which data associated with them is used – creating an opportunity to create favourable impression online.

\subsubsection{Objectives}

To create a solution demonstrating an acceptable level of technical/business nous, the group must:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Design a user experience workflow document which highlights key aspects of the app’s UI
	\item Create an Android mobile app with the following components:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Web crawler tool that will trawl the Internet to gather information related to a user
			\item Sentiment analysis tool that will detect the contextual polarity of user posts
			\item Image processing tool that will detect and describe features across two images
			\item Social media profile tool that will allow the user to manage accounts connected to the app
		\end{itemize}
	\item Devise a business model utilising Maurya’s Lean Canvas methodology consisting of:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A problem that the group is trying to solve
			\item The features of the solution that solve the problems identified 
			\item The overall cost of commercialising the solution (over a 3-year span)
			\item The identified target audience for the solution and the appropriate path to customers
			\item Potential revenue streams once the solution is bought to market (over a 3-year span)
			\item Key metrics that will need to be measured to facilitate market growth
		\end{itemize}
	\item Consult with various stakeholders to determine the legibility of any ideas presented
	\item Develop a risk assessment matrix to keep small issues from becoming emergencies
	\item Develop a plan to guide task execution and control over the life of the project
	\item Complete the entry form to the ATOS IT Challenge by 30 November 2015
	\item Define the roles and responsibilities of each individual involved in the project 
	\item Create a report describing the development of the solution with the following sections:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Introduction
			\item Literature Review
			\item Requirements
			\item Design
			\item Implementation
			\item Evaluation
			\item Conclusion
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Constraints}

The group must keep in mind the following project constraints while developing the solution:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Time – the group has 8 months (October 2015 to May 2016) to meet the listed objectives
	\item Cost – the group has an initial budget of £100 which cannot be exceeded
	\item Resources – the group must develop the required technical competencies to develop the solution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Client}

Atos S.E.~(ATO) is a France-based company that provides IT services~\parencite{web:reuters}. The company provides an assortment of services, including: bespoke enterprise software, e-payment services, business integration solutions and cloud services. In addition, the company serves clients in various industries, including: energy and utilities, financial services, manufacturing, retail, public sector, healthcare and transport. Over time, Atos has developed strategic alliances with Cisco, Dell, EMC, Hitachi, Microsoft, Oracle, Samsung, SAP, Siemens and VMWare; and strategic business partnerships with HP and IBM~\parencite{web:bloomberg}. This has allowed them to significantly leverage their service offerings and develop the credibility required to attract new trade. For example, the company was recently awarded a \pounds 6m contract to run Transport for London's service desk, a move that will see them responsible for logging, tracking and managing requests such as e-mail configuration, printing and remote access for 25\,000 users across multiple locations~\parencite{web:jee}.

\subsection{The Project}

The group has been tasked with the job of creating a solution to track and identify one’s online personal data on behalf of Atos. The solution must be capable of securing, filtering or bringing added value to the data. Consequently, the group must start thinking about actions, functionalities or objectives that might be useful in the solution to protect personal data, for example: automatic de-subscription, notifications, deletion, or ensuring results do not appear in search engine top hits.

\subsection{The Team}

The following section outlines the expected roles and responsibilities for each individual involved in this project. However, due to the dynamic nature of the project, roles may be re-assigned to one or more individuals throughout the duration of the project. As a result, individuals may need to play a different role than that which was initially outlined. This approach to team development correlates to~\textcite{book:xteams} ideas on adaptive team structure within organisations:

\subsubsection{Jeansy Molanza -- Project Management/Business Analyst}

As Project Manager, Jeansy will be responsible for the successful initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, controlling and closure of the project. As Business Analyst, Jeansy will be responsible for the design of solutions that will deliver value to stakeholders -- acting as an agent of change whenever necessary.

\subsubsection{Gary Bennett -- Front End Development/Business Analyst}

As Front End Developer, Gary will be responsible for implementing interactive elements, translating UI/UX wireframes to actual code that will produce the solution's interface that the end user engages with. As Business Analyst, Gary will be responsible for the bridging the gap between technical and project requirements.

\subsubsection{Jiefei Wei/Rawand Hawiz -- Back End Development}

As part of the Back End Development team, Jiefei and Rawand will be responsible for implementing server-side application logic; creating the application's API to facilitate database interaction and intelligent agents tasked with performing a service on a regular schedule. In addition, Jiefei and Rawand will be in charge of writing unit tests and source control.
